[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

We find that Cohen's *d* for the total weight between first babies and others is about -0.089. This tells us that the mean difference between the groups has a magnitude of much less than 1 standard deviation. Thus, this suggests that there is no practical difference in mean total weight between first babies and others.

We have also seen that Cohen's *d* for the pregnancy length between the two groups is 0.029. Thus, it seems that there is no practical difference in mean pregnancy length between the two groups either.
