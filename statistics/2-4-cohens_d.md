[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

We find that Cohen's *d* in total weight between first babies and other babies is about -0.089. This tells us that the mean difference between the groups has a magnitude much less than 1 standard deviation. This suggests that there is no practical difference in total weight between first born and non first born babies.

We have also seen that Cohen's *d* for the pregnancy length between the two groups is 0.029. Thus, it seems that there is no practical difference in pregnancy length between the two groups either.
