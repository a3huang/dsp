[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

We can see that the histogram looks roughly like the PDF of a uniform distribution on [0, 1]. The empirical CDF looks roughly like the graph of the function defined by f(x) = x on [0, 1]. Thus, the distribution of the 1000 numbers randomly drawn from random.random seem to be approximately uniformly distributed.
